00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:29.440
Under the glow of the silver moon, I find my heart in a tender tune.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:38.320
Every step brings me close to you, every moment feels so true.

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:43.140
Soft is the night as it holds our song.

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:51.479
In your embraces where I belong, every glance is a sweet surprise.

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:55.679
I keep dancing in your eyes.

00:00:56.679 --> 00:01:02.000
Round and round the wall fades away.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:10.840
Love is the music and we will sway.

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:24.040
Hand in hand through the gentle sky, forever dancing.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.879
In your eyes.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:39.640
No time, no fear, just you and me spinning like waves on a timeless sea.

00:01:40.379 --> 00:01:47.439
Every heart retails me, it's true, my forever begins with you.

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:12.379
Round and round the world fades away.

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:20.740
Love is the music and we will sway.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:33.860
Hand in hand through the gentle sky, forever dancing.

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:38.259
In your eyes.

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:20.719
Round and round the wall fades away.

00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:22.060
Round and round the wall fades away.
