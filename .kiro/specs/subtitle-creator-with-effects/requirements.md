# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Subtitle Creator with Effects is a desktop application that enables users to create stylized subtitle videos by combining background media (images or videos), timed lyrics/subtitles, and visual effects. The application provides a WYSIWYG interface for previewing, editing, and exporting professional-quality subtitle videos with synchronized text overlays and visual enhancements.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to import various background media formats, so that I can use existing images or videos as the foundation for my subtitle videos.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects an image file (JPG, PNG, GIF) THEN the system SHALL convert it to a video clip with configurable duration
2. WHEN a user selects a video file (MP4, AVI, MOV, MKV) THEN the system SHALL load it with its existing audio track if present
3. WHEN a video file has no audio track THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to import external audio
4. IF the background is an image or silent video THEN the system SHALL require audio input to determine final video length
5. WHEN media import fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages with suggested solutions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to import subtitle files in standard formats, so that I can work with existing subtitle content or create new timed text overlays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user imports a JSON subtitle file THEN the system SHALL parse the custom structured format with word-level timing
2. WHEN a user imports an .ASS subtitle file THEN the system SHALL parse the standard format with timing and basic styling
3. WHEN the system detects a subtitle file format THEN it SHALL automatically convert it to the internal data structure
4. IF a subtitle file is malformed THEN the system SHALL display specific parsing errors and line numbers
5. WHEN no subtitle file is provided THEN the system SHALL allow manual subtitle creation through the editor

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want real-time preview capabilities, so that I can see exactly how my subtitle video will look before exporting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user plays the preview THEN the system SHALL render video using MoviePy at reduced resolution for smooth playback
2. WHEN the user scrubs the timeline THEN the system SHALL provide frame-accurate seeking with subtitle preview
3. WHEN the user applies effects THEN the system SHALL show instant preview without full render
4. WHEN the user modifies subtitle timing THEN the preview SHALL update in real-time
5. IF preview rendering fails THEN the system SHALL display error messages while maintaining interface responsiveness

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a subtitle editor, I want comprehensive text editing capabilities, so that I can precisely control subtitle content, timing, and appearance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on a subtitle line THEN the system SHALL allow direct text content modification
2. WHEN a user adjusts timing controls THEN the system SHALL update start/end times with numerical input and drag functionality
3. WHEN a user selects multiple subtitle lines THEN the system SHALL enable batch timing adjustments
4. WHEN a user modifies word-level timing THEN the system SHALL support karaoke-style synchronization
5. WHEN a user saves edits THEN the system SHALL export modified subtitles back to JSON or .ASS formats

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to apply visual effects to subtitles, so that I can create engaging and professional-looking videos.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects text styling options THEN the system SHALL provide font family, size, weight, color, and positioning controls
2. WHEN a user applies animation effects THEN the system SHALL support karaoke highlight, scale bounce, typewriter, and fade transitions
3. WHEN a user adds particle effects THEN the system SHALL provide configurable hearts, stars, music notes, sparkles, and custom images
4. WHEN a user combines multiple effects THEN the system SHALL support effect stacking and layering
5. WHEN a user creates effect combinations THEN the system SHALL allow saving and loading as reusable presets

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want flexible export options, so that I can generate videos in appropriate formats and quality for my intended use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates export THEN the system SHALL provide quality presets (High 1080p, Medium 720p, Low 480p)
2. WHEN a user needs custom settings THEN the system SHALL allow manual configuration of resolution, FPS, and bitrate
3. WHEN a user selects export format THEN the system SHALL support MP4, AVI, and MOV with appropriate codec options
4. WHEN export is in progress THEN the system SHALL display real-time progress with ETA calculation
5. WHEN export completes or fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear status messages and error handling

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want an intuitive desktop interface, so that I can efficiently navigate between preview, editing, and export functions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application launches THEN the system SHALL display a main window with menu bar, toolbar, and organized panels
2. WHEN a user interacts with the left panel THEN the system SHALL provide video preview with timeline scrubber and playback controls
3. WHEN a user accesses the right panel THEN the system SHALL show text style controls and effects panel with parameters
4. WHEN a user works with the bottom panel THEN the system SHALL provide lyric timeline editor with line selection and timing controls
5. WHEN a user performs any operation THEN the interface SHALL remain responsive and provide appropriate feedback

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want reliable audio integration, so that my subtitle videos have properly synchronized sound.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN audio is imported THEN the system SHALL support MP3, WAV, AAC, and OGG formats
2. WHEN audio duration is determined THEN the system SHALL set the final video length accordingly
3. WHEN background video has existing audio THEN the system SHALL use it by default with option to override
4. WHEN audio and subtitle timing conflict THEN the system SHALL provide synchronization tools
5. WHEN audio processing fails THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages with troubleshooting guidance
