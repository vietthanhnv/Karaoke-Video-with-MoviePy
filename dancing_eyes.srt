1
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:29,440
Under the glow of the silver moon, I find my heart in a tender tune.

2
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:38,320
Every step brings me close to you, every moment feels so true.

3
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:43,140
Soft is the night as it holds our song.

4
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:51,479
In your embraces where I belong, every glance is a sweet surprise.

5
00:00:51,979 --> 00:00:55,679
I keep dancing in your eyes.

6
00:00:56,679 --> 00:01:02,000
Round and round the wall fades away.

7
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:10,840
Love is the music and we will sway.

8
00:01:13,299 --> 00:01:24,040
Hand in hand through the gentle sky, forever dancing.

9
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,879
In your eyes.

10
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:39,640
No time, no fear, just you and me spinning like waves on a timeless sea.

11
00:01:40,379 --> 00:01:47,439
Every heart retails me, it's true, my forever begins with you.

12
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:12,379
Round and round the world fades away.

13
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:20,740
Love is the music and we will sway.

14
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:33,860
Hand in hand through the gentle sky, forever dancing.

15
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:38,259
In your eyes.

16
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:20,719
Round and round the wall fades away.

17
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:22,060
Round and round the wall fades away.
